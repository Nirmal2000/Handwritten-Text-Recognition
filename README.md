# Handwritten-Text-Recognition


The model predicts handwritten texts to actual texts. The input to be provided is a picture of an image containing a word and output is the text.

# How to create data for use with the model

Suppose given an image:
![Image with words](https://github.com/Nirmal2000/Handwritten-Text-Recognition/blob/master/src/allimg/5680.jpg)

We can segment the words in the image:
![Segmented words](https://github.com/Nirmal2000/Handwritten-Text-Recognition/blob/master/src/suc.png)

Crop the words into different imaages and feed to the model.

Output in /src/words.txt
