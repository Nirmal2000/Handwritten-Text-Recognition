succeeded
in
having
pentour
taken
to
the
mines,
instead
of
to
the
quarries
of
chennu.
i
knew,
said
the
soldier
in
his
homely
way,
from
uarda
where
this
man,
who
had
risked
his
life
for
us
poor
folks,
was
to
the
taken,
and
i
said
to
myself
i
must
save
him.
but
thinking
is
not
my
trade,
and
i
never
can
lay
a
plot.
it
would
very
likely
have
come
to
some
violent
act,
that
would
have
ended
badly,
if
i
had
not
had
a
hint
from
another
person,
even
before
uarda
told
me
of
what
threatened
pentour.
this
is
how
it
was,
i
was
to
convey
the
prisoners,
who
were
condemned
to
work
in
the
mafkat
mines,
across
the
river
to
the
place
they
start
from.
in
the
harbor
of
thefes,
on
the
other
sides,
the
poor
wretches
were
to
take
leave
of
their
friends;
i
have
seen
it
a
hundred
times,
and
i
never
can
get
used
to
it,
and
yet
one
can
get
hardened
to
most
things
their
loud
cries,
and
wild
howls
are
not
the
worst
those
that
scream
the
most
i
have
always
found
are
the
first
to
get
used
to
their
fate;
but
the
pale
ones,
whose
lips
turn
white,and
whose
teeth
chatter
as
if
they
were
freezing,
and
whose
eyes
stare
out
into
vacancy
without
any
tears
those
go
to
my
heart.
there
was
all
the
usual
misery,
both
noisy
and
silent.
but
the
man
i
was
most
sorry
for
was
one
i
had
known
for
a
long
time;
his
name
was
huni,
and
he
belonged
to
the
temple
of
amon,
where
he
held
the
place
of
oversees
of
the
attendants
on
the
sacred
goat.
i
had
often
met
him
when
i
was
on
duty
to
watch
the
laborers
who
were
completing
the
great
pillared
hall,
and
he
was
respected
by
every
one,
and
never
failed
in
his
duty.
once,
however,
he
had
neglecled
it;
it
was
that
very
night
which
you
all
will
remember
when
the
wolves
broke
into
the
temple,
and
tore
the
rams,
and
the
sacred
heart
was
laid
in
the
breast
of
the
prophet
rui.
some
one,
of
course,

you

you
are

it

only
when
you
awake
from
your
dream
that
you
realize
it
wasnt
your
normal
reality,
but
while
you
are
there,
its
as
real
as
anywhere;
in
fact,
while
you
are
dreaming
you
usually
have
no
recollection
of
your
normal
waking
life,
so
that
dreamworld
appears
to
be
your
normal
existence.
it
is
only
when
you
awaken
that
it
becomes
a
vague
shadow
of
fragmented
memories
and
experiences
which
usually
dont
make
much

bob
gazed
with
admiration
and
delight
on
this
truly
admirable
and
extensive
pike
of
national
architecture;
the
gentle
breeze
from
the
river,
the
occasional
dash
of
the
oar,
and
the
activity
which
appeared
on
board
the
different
vessels;
together
with
the
view
of

side,
over
which
he
could
perceive
pedestrians

vehicles
of
various
kinds
passing

repassing,

the

on
the

conspired
to
heighten
and
give
a
most
imposing
effect
to
the
scene.
the

said
tallyho,
are
truly
creditable
to
the
taste

the

was
rosy
with
the
approaching
sun

when
they
quitted
the
precincts

at
this
moment
the
pioneer
paaker
advanced
to
meet
the
king,
threw
himself
on
the
ground
before
him,
kissed
the
earth,
and

answer
to

question
as
to
why
he
had
come
without

told
him
that

from

the
guilty
color,

changed

hitherto
to

is
it
with

asked
ramneses.

commanded
the

and
paaker
obeyed.
they
went
on
in
silence,
followed
by
the
vast
troop
of
chariots
through
the
dewy
morning
air
first
across
the
plain,
and
then
into
the
mountain
range.
the
corps
of
ra,
armed
with
bows
and
arrows,
preceeded
them
to
clear
the
way;
they
crossed
the
narrow
bed
of
a
dry
torrent,
and
then
a
broad
valley
opened
before
them,
extending
to
the
right
and
left
and
enclosed
by
ranges
of
mountains.
the
road
is

said

the
mohar
has
learned
his
duties
from
his
with
the
hum
of
excitement
that
greeted
our
coming
forward
hushed
once
more
to
silence.
i
could
feel
that
i
might
now
commence
the
attack,
but
my
masters
lessons
all
came
clear
and
vivid
before
me,
and
knowing
that,
as
the
weaker,
it
was
my
duty
to
act
on
the
defensive,
i
waited,
while
we
watched
each
other
cautiously,
my
adversary
evidently
expecting
that
i
should
begin.
but,
as
i
did
not,
he
attached
again,
and
though
i
managed
to
give
him
several
telling
blows,
he
closed
with
me
before
i
could
avoid
him,
and
in
the
tussle
which
followed
i
went
down
heavily,
my
head
coming
in
violent
contact
with
the
floor,
everything
passed
away
then
for
a
few
moments
except
sparks
dancing
before
my
eyes,
but
i
was
conscious
directly
of
mercers
voice,
as
he
whispered
to
me
excitely,
oh
dont
let
him
lick
you,
frank
dont
let
him
lick
you,

no,

panted,

short,

so
giddy.
had
enough
of
it
cried
burr
major,
and
the
giddiness
passed
away
directly
as
i
rose
and
faced
him.
satisfied
by
the
result
of
his
last
manoeuvre,
he
tried
it
again,
but
this
time
i
was
prepared,
and,
stepping
on
one
side,
i
gave
him,
or
rather
my
fist
of
itself
seemed
to
give
him,
a
stinging
blow
on
the
ear,
which
had
so
staggering
an
effect
that,
as
he
swung
round
and
came
on
again,
i
was
able
to
follow
up
my
blow
with
three
or
four
more,
and
the
poor
fellow
went
down
crash,
it
was
his
turn
to
look
dazed
and
heavy
now,
and
quite
half
the
boys
crowded
round,
giving
me
advice,
bidding
me,
go
it,
and
working
themselves
up
to
a
tremendous
pitch
of
excitement.
then
we
were
facing
each
other
again,
with
all
pity
and
compunction
gone,
and,
after
receiving
one
or
two
blows,
i
forgot
everything
but
the
fact
that
there
was
something
before
me
that
i
must
hit,
and
hit
it
i
did,
my
deliveries,
as
it
happened,
being
quite
in
accordance
with
lomaxs
teaching,
which
somehow
came
natural
to
me;
and
then
i
found
reflux
of
those
seas,
there
he
sustained
great
want
of
provisions,
so
as
they
were
constrained
to
go
ashore
every
day
to
seek
sustenance,
and
not
finding
anything
else,
they
were
forced
to
kill
and
eat
monkeys,
and
other
animals,
such
as
they
could
find,
at
last
in
the
altitude
of
the
cape
of
gracias
a
dios,
near
a
certain
little
island
called
de
las
pertas,
his
ship
struck
on
a
bank
of
sand,
where
it
stuck
so
fast,
as
no
art
could
get
her
off
again,
though
they
unladed
all
the
gus,
iron,
and
other
weighty
things
as
much
as
they
could.
hereupon
they
were
forced
to
break
the
pieces,
and
with
planks
and
nails
build
themselves
a
a
get
away;
and
while
they
are
busy
about
it,
i
shall
describe
the
said
isles
and
their
inhabitants.
the
islands
de
las
pertas
are
inhabited
by
savage
indians,
nor
having
known
or
conversed
with
civil
people:
they
are
tall
and
very
nimble,
running
almost
as
fast
as
horses;
at
diving
also
they
are
very
dextrous
and
hardy,
from
the
bottom
of
the
sea
i
saw
them
take
up
an
never
said
an
unkind
word
to
him,
but
his
defiance
and
wildness
melted
before
her
beauty,
her
quiet,
aristocratic
manner.
he
scarcely
knew
himself
whether
he
loved
her
or
not,
but
she
appeared
like
the
good
fairy
of
whom
the
fairy
tales
spoke,
and
it
often
seemed
as
if
she
were
for
too
delicate,
dainty
and
charming
for
her
simple,
unpretending
home,
to
see
her
smile
rendered
the
boy
happy,
and
when
she
looked
sad
a
thing
that
often
happened
it
made
his
heart
ache.
mercyful
heavens
she
certainly
could
not
receive
him
kindly
when
she
saw
his
doublet,
the
ruffles
thrust
into
his
pocket,
and
his
unlucky
stockings
and
then
there
were
the
bells
ringing
again
the
dinner
hour
had
long
since
passed,
and
his
father
waited
for
no
one.
whoever
came
too
late
must
go
without,
unless
aunt
barbara
took
compassion
on
him
in
the
kitchen.
but
what
was
the
use
of
pondering
and
hesitating
adrian
summoned
up
all
his
courage,
clenched
his
teeth,
clasped
his
right
hand
still
closer
around
the
torn
ruffles
in
his
pocket,
and
struck
the
knocker
loudly
on
the
steel
plate
beneath,

opened
the
door,
and
in
the
spacious,
dusky
entrance
hall,
where
the
bales
of
leather
were
packed
closely
together,
did
not
notice
the
dilapidation
of
his
outer
man.
he
hurried
swiftly
up
the
stairs.
the

was
open,
and
marvelous
the
table
was
still
untouched,
his
father
must
have
remained
at

than

adrian
rushed
with
long
leaps
to
his
little
attic
room,
dressed
himself
neatly,
and
entered
the
presence
of
his
family
before
the
master
of
the
house
had
asked
the
blessing.

that

of
ecstasy
and
guilt.
and
even
critically,
too.

the

called.
she
cried
sharply
aloud
the

came
unsummoned,
in

of
herself
why,
they
had
Just

followed

the

it
all
her

that
it

she
saw
the

set
himself
to

take
it
in
the
face,
and
go
off
balance.
and
set
and
take
it
again,
and
she
didnt
cry
out
any
more.
she
leaned
forward,
so
tensely
set
herself
in
every
muscle
that
she
found
she
was
tired
when
the
trainer
stopped
it.
time
the
trainer
she
learned
then
was
not

he
snarled
at

there

with

he

the
power
of

of

with
as
much
vividness
as
the

of

and
indulged
in
this

not
only
through

but
in
long
rides
and
drives
through
silent
wastes,
such
visions
were
commonly
followed
by
a
vehement
and
boiling
overflow
of
his
hatred
against
the
charioteer,
and
a
whole
series
of
fervent
preyers
for
his
destruction
paaker
set
the
cup
of
water
for
nefert
on
the
flat
stone
and
felt
fro
the
philter,
his
soul
was
so
full
of
desire
that
there
was
no
room
for
hatred;
still
he
could
not
altogether
exclude
the
idea
that
he
would
commit
a
great
crime
by
making
use
of
a
magic
drink
before
pouring
the
fateful
drops
into
the
water,
he
would
consult
the
oracle
of
the
ring,
the
dagger
touched
none
of
the
holy
symbols
of
the
inscription
on
the
signet,
and
in
other
circumstances
he
would,
without
going
any
farther,
have
given
up
his
project.
but
this
time
he
unwillingly
returned
it
to
its
sheath,
pressed
the
gold
ring
to
his
heart,
muttered
the
name
of
his
brother
in
osiris,
and
awaited
the
first
living
creature
that
might
come
towards
him.
he
had
not
long
to
wait,
from
the
mountain
slope
opposite
to
him
rose,
with
heavy,
slow
wing
stroke,
two
light
colored
vultures.
in
anxious
suspense
he
followed
their
flight,
as
they
rose,
higher
and
higher.
for
a
moment
they
poised
motionless,
borne
up
by
the
air,
circled
round
each
other,
then
wheeled
to
the
left
fugitive
spaniards
lay
hid,
which
not
being
able
afterwards
to
perform,
they
were
put
to
more
cruel
deaths
than
they
who
were
dead
before.
the
prisoners
being
all
dead
but
two
whom
they
reserved
to
show
them
what
they
desired,
they
marched
hence
to
the
town
of
san
pedro,
or
st.
peter,
ten
or
twelve
leagues
from
puerto
cavallo,
being
three
hundred
men,
whom
lolonois
led,
leaving
behind
him
moses
van
vin
his
lieutenant,
to
govern
the
rest
in
his
absence.
being
come
three
leagues
on
their
way,
they
met
with
a
troop
of
spaniards,
who
lay
in
ambuscade
for
their
coming;
these
they
set
upon,
with
all
the
courage
imaginable,
and
at
last
totally
defeated
howbeit,
they
behaved
themselves
very
manfully
at
first;
but
not
being
able
to
resist
the
fury
of
the
pirates,
they
were
forced
to
give
way,
and
save
themselves
by
flight,
leaveing
many
pirates
dead
in
the
place,
some
wounded,
and
somd
of
their
own
party
maimed,
by
the
way.
these
lolonois
put
to
death
without
mercy,
having
asked
them
what
questions
he
thought
fit
for
his
purpose.
there
were
still
remaining
some
few
prisoners
not
wounded;
these
were
asked
by
lolonois,
if
any
more
spaniards
did
lie
farther
on
in
ambuscade
they
answered,
there
were
then
being
brought
before
him.
one
by
one,
he
asked
if
there
was
no
other
way
to
town
but
submit
to
the
sword,
seeing
no
milder
usage
would
do
it;
hereupon
they
killed
some
of
them,
and
quartering
their
bodies,
placed
them
in
the
highways,
that
others
might
take
warning
from
such
a
punishment;
but
this
severity
proved
of
ill
consequence,
for
instead
of
fighting
them
and
reducing
them
to
civility,
they
conceived
such
horror
of
the
spaniards,
that
they
resolved
to
detest
and
fly
their
sight
for
ever;
hence
the
greatest
part
died
in
caves
and
subterraneous
places
of
the
woods
and
mountains,
in
which
places
i
myself
have
often
seen
great
numbers
of
human
bones.
the
spaniards
finding
no
more
indians
to
appear
about
the
woods,
turned
away
a
great
number
of
dogs
they
had
in
their
houses,
and
they
finding
no
masters
to
keep
them,
betook
themselves
to
the
woods
and
fields
to
hunt
for
food
to
preserve
their
lives;
thus
by
degrees
they
became
unacquainted
with
houses,
and
grew
wild.
this
is
the
truest
account
i
can
give
of
the
multitudes
of
wild
dogs
in
these
parts,
but
besied
these
wild
mastiffs,
here
are
also
great
numbers
of
wild
horses

they
are
but
low
of
stature,
short
bodied,
with
great
heads,
long
necks,
and
big
or
thick
legs:
in
a
word,
they
have
nothing
handsome
in
their
shape.

run
u

of

travelling
through

they
stand
still,
suffering
him
to

till
he
can
almost
touch

then
suddenly
starting,
they
betake

to
flight
running
away
as
fast
as
they
can.

that

never

you
have
aroused
on
interest
in
your
strange
friend,
and
some
other
time
must
tell
me
more
about
her,
only
this
one
question:
can
a
modest
maiden
talk
of
her
with
you
without
disgrace
certainly,
if
you
do
not
shrink
from
speaking
of
a
noble
lady
who
had
no
other
protection
than
herself
and
you
dont
forger

cried
henrica,
leaving
the
room.
the
musician

thoughtfully
towards
home,
was
isabella
a
relative
of
this
young
girl
he
had
told
henrica
almost
all
he
knew
of
her
external
circumstances,
and
this
perhaps
gave
the
former
the
same
right
to
call
her
an
adventuress,
that
many
in
rome
had
assumed.
the
word
wounded
him,
and
henrica
inquiry
whether
he
loved
the
stranger
disturbed
him,
and
appeared
intrusive
and
unseemly.
yes,
he
had
felt
an
ardent
love
for
her;
ay,
he
had
suffered
deeply
because
he
was
no
more
to
her
than
a
pleasan
companion
and
reliable
friend.
it
had
cost
him
struggles
enough
to
conceal
his
feelings
and
he
knew,
that
but
for
the
dread
of
repulse
and
scorn,
he
would
have
yielded
and
revealed
them
to
her.
old
wounds
in
his
heart
opened
afresh,
as
he
recalled
the
time
she
suddenly
left
tome
without
a
word
of
farewell.
after
barely
recovering
from
a
severe
illness,
he
had
returned
home
pale
and
dispirited,
and
months
elapsed
ere
he
could
again
find
genuine
pleasure
in
his
art,
at
first,
the
remembrance
of
her
contained
nothing
save
bitterness,
but
now,
by
quiet,
persistent
effort,
he
had
unexpected
attack
upon
me
with
questions
uttered
in
the
severest
of
tones.
all
this
meant
long
hours
of
what
the
masters
called
private
study
and
the
boys
private
worry;
while
in
addition
there
were
the
lessons
we
inflicted
upon
ourselves,
for
we
never
once
failed
of
being
at
the
lodge
by
five
oclock
on
those
summer
mornings,
to
be
scolded,
punched,
and
generally
knocked
about
by
our
instructor

to
compulsory
games
at
cricket,
as
they
were
called,
but
which
were
really
hours
of
toil,
fielding
for
burr
major,
hodson
and
dicksee;
sundry
expeditions
after
specimens,
visits
to
bob
hopley,
bathing,
fishing,
and
excursions
and
uncursions
generally,
and
it
will
be
seen
that
neither
mercer
not
i
had
much
spare
time.
a
busy
life
is
after
all
the
happiest,
and
though
my
lessons
often
worried
and
puzzled
me,
i
was
perfectly
content,
and
my
friendly
relations
with
mercer
rapidly
grew
more
firm.
i
say,
he
cried
one
morning,
after
lomax
had
grumbled
at
us
a
little
less
than
usual
respecting
our
execution
of
several
of
a
miserable
manner,
till
he
lost
the
very
shape
of
a
man;
not
ceasing
to
howl
and
cry,
without
any
rest
by
day
or
night.
thus
he
continued
raving
mad,
till
he
died.
many
other
examples
of
this
kind
i
could
rehearse;
but
these
not
belonging
to
our
present
discourse,
i
omit
them.
the
planters
of
the
caribbee
islands
are
rather
worse,
and
more
cruel
to
their
servants,
than
the
former.
in
the
isle
of
at
christopher
dwells
one
named
bettesa,
well
known
to
the
dutch
merchants,
who
has
killed
above
a
hundred
of
his
servants
with
blows
and
stripes.
the
english
do
the
same
with
their
servants;
and
the
mildest
cruelty
they
exercise
towards
them
is,
that
when
they
have
served
six
years
of
their
time
they
being
bound
among
the
english
for
seven
they
use
them
so
cruelly,
as
to
force
them
to
beg
of
their
masters
to
sell
them
to
others.
though
it
be
to
begin
another
servitude
of
seven
years,
or
at
least
three
or
four,
and
i
have
known
many,
who
have
thus
served
fifteen
or
twenty
years,
before
they
could
obtain
their
feedom.
another
law
very
rigouous
in
that
nation,
is
if
any
man
owes
another
above
twenty
five
shilings
english,
if
he
cannot
pay
it,
he
is
liable
to
be
sold
for
six
or
eight
months.
not
to
trouble
the
reader
any
longer
with
relations
of
this
kind.
i
shall
now
describe
the
famous
actions
an
explots
of
the
greatest
pirates
of
my
time,
during
my
residence
in
those
parts:
these
i
shall
relate
without
the
peace;
it
hath
always
been
answered,
that
such
men
did
not
commit
those
acts
of
hostility
and
piracy
as
subjects
to
their
majesties;
and
therefore
his
catholic
majesty
might
proceed
against
them
as
he
should
think
fit.
the
king
of
france
added,
that
he
had
no
fortress
nor
castle
upon
hispaniola,
neither
with
only
one
boat,
and
twenty
eight
men
now
till
that
time
the
opaniards
had
passed
and
repassed
to
rameri,
who
was
about
to
slip
down
the
rope
they
had
contrived,
the
last
of
them
all.

the
frightful
leap;
one
false
step,
and
he
must
meet
with
the
same
fearful
death
as
his
enemy
paaker,
while
the
bystanders
watched
him
in
breathless
silence
while
the
crackling
of
the
wood,
the
roar
of
the
flames,
and
the
dull
thump
of
falling
timber
mingled
with
the
distant
chant
of
a
procession
of

were
now
approaching

she
watched
every
movement
of
her
husband,
and
she
bit
her
lips
till
they
bled
not
to
cry
out,
she
felt
that
he
was
acting
bravely
and
nobly,
and
that
he
was
lost
if
even
for
an
instant
his
attention
were
distracted
from
his
perilous
footing
now
he
had
reached
rameri,
and
bound
one
end
of
the
rope
made
out
of
cloaks
and
handkerchiefs,
round
his
body;
then
he
gave
the
other
end
to
rameri,
who
held
fast
to
the
window
still,
and
prepared
once
more
to
spring.
nefert
saw
him
ready
to
leap,
she
pressed
her
hands
upon
her
lops
to
repress
a
scream,
she
shut
her
eyes,
and
when
she
opened
then
again
he
had
accomplished
the
first
leap,
and
at
the
second
the
gods
preserved
him
from
faling;
at
the
third
the
king
held
out
his
hand
to
him,
and
saved
him
from
a
fall.
then
remeses
helped
him
to
unfasten
the
rope
from
round
his
waist
to
fasten
it
to
the
end
of
a
beam.
rameru
now
loosened
the
other
end,
and
followed
menas
example;
he
too,
practised
in
athletic
exercises
in
the
school
of
the
house
of
seti,
succeeded
in
accomplishing
the
three
tremendous
leaps,
and
soon

king

safety

irresistible
broad
humour
of
the
subjects
had
taken
fast
hold
of
his
risible
muscles,
and
in
turning
them
over
one
after
the
other,
he
found
it
difficult
to
part
with
such
a
rich
fund
of
humour,
and
still
more
so
to
stiffle
the
violent
emotion
it
excited
at
length,
clapping
his
hands
to
his
sides,
he
gave
full
vent
to
the
impulse
in
a
horse
laugh
from
a
pair
of
truly
stentorian
lungs,
and
was
by
main
force
dragged
out
by
his
companions.

and

if
one
kept
ones
mind
on
relative
values
and
off
ones
own
financial
troubles;
cheap

one
didnt

to
recollect
that
six

at
the
moment,

in
having
pentour
taken
to

of
to

i
knew,
said
the
soldier
in
his
homely
way,
from
uarda
where
this
man,
who
had
risked
his
life
for
us
poor
folks,
was
to
the
taken,
and
i
said
to
myself
i
must
save
him.
but
thinking
is
not
my
trade,
and
i
never
can
lay
a
plot.
it
would
very
likely
have
come
to
some
violent
act,
that
would
have
ended
badly,
if
i
had
not
had
a
hint
from
another
person,
even
before
uarda
told
me
of
what
threatened
this
is
how
it
was,
i
was
to
convey
the
prisoners,
who
were
condemned
to
work
in
the
mafkat
mines,
across
the
river
to
the
place
they
start
from.
in
the
harbor
of
thebes,
on
the
other
sides,
the
poor
wretches
were
to
take
leave
of
their
friends;
i
have
seen
it
a
hundred
times,
and
i
never
can
get
used
to
it,
and
yet
one
can
get
hardened
to
most
things
their
loud
cries,
and
wild
howls
are
not
the
worst
those
that
scream
the
most
i
have
always
found
are
the
first
to
get
used
to
their
fate;
but
the
pale
ones,
whose
lips
turn
white,
and
whose
teeth
chatter
as
if
they
were
freezing,
and
whose
eyes
stare
out
into
vacancy
without
any
tears
those
go
to
my
heart.
there
was
all
the
usual
misery,
both
noisy
and
silent.
but
the
man
i
was
most
sorry
for
was
one
i
had
known
for
a
long
time;
his
name
was
huni,
and
he
belonged
to
the
temple
of
amon,
where
he
held
the
place
of
oversees
of
the
attendants
on
the
sacred
goat.
i
had
often
met
him
when
i
was
on
duty
to
watch
the
laborers
who
were
completing
the
great
pillared
hall,
and
he
was
respected
by
every
one,
and
never
failed
in
his
duty.
once,
however,
he
had
neglecled
it;
it
was
that
very
night
which
you
all
will
remember
when
the
wolves
broke
into
the
temple,
and
tore
the
rams,
and
the
sacred
heart
was
laid
in
the
breast
of
the
prophet
rui.
some
one,
of
course,
must
be
punished,
and
it
fell
on
poor
huni,
who
for
his
carelessness
was
condemned
to
forced
labor
in
the
mines
of
mafkat.
his
with
this
introduction
of
reason
into
the
all,
you
provide
yourself
with
a
self
devised
ruler,
who
terribly
resembles
the
gracious
masters
and
mistress
that
you
exhibit
to
the
people.
only
apparently,
answered
pentour,
only
because
that
which
transcends
sense
is
communicable
through
the
medium
of
the
senses
alone.
when
god
manifests
himself
as
the
wisdom
of
the
world,
we
call
him
the
word,
he,
who
covers
his
limbs
with
names,
as
the
sacred
text
expresses
itself
is
the
power
which
gives
to
things
their
distinctive
forms;
the
scarabaeus,
which
enters
life
as
its
own
son
reminds
us
of
the
ever
self
renewing
creative
power
which
causes
you
to
call
our
merciful
and
benevolent
god
a
monster,
but
which
you
can
deny
as
little
as
you
can
the
happy
choice
of
the
type;
for,
as
you
know,
there
are
only
male
scarabei,

animal

if
all
the
doctrines
of
the
mysteries,
he
said,
have
no
more
truth
than
this
happily
chosen
image,
they
are
in
a
bda
way,
these
beetles
have
for
years
been
my
friends
and
companions.
i
know
their
family
life,
and
i
can
assure
you
tht
there
are
males

amongst
them
as
amongst

your
good
god
i
do
not
know,
and
what
i
least
comprehend
in
thinking
it
over
quietly
is
the
circumstance
that
you
distinguish
a
good
and
principle
in
the
world.
if
the
all
is
indeed
god,
if
god
as
the

teach,
is
goodness,

if
besides
him
is
nothing
at
all,
where
is
a
place
to
be
found

evil
you

boy,

the

one,

prescribes
his

laws

his

paths,

to
the

continuance

continual
renewal,

what
we
call
evil,
darkness,
wickedness,
is
in

only
send
horses
or
the
carriage
for

your

i
wont

good
bye,
nice
your
riding
boots
and
greeb
cloth
doublet
are
much
more
becoming
than
those
silk
fal
lals,
the
young
lady
kissed
her
hand
to
the
youth,
who
had
already
swing
himself
into
the
saddle,
and
hurried
back
to
the
house,
her
uncle
shrugged
his
shoulders,
mounted
the
roan,
wrapped
the
dark
cloak
closer
around
him,
beckoned
nicolas
to
his
side,
and
rode
on
with
him
in
advance
of
the
servants.
no
word
was
exchanged
between
them,
so
long
as
their
way
led
through
the
city,
but
outside
the
gate,
wibisma
said;
henrica
finds
the
time
long
in
leyden;
she
would
like
to
go
back
to
her
father
it
cant
be
very
pleasant
to
stay
with
aunt
replied
the
youth
she
is
old
and
sick
brute
force
my
lad;
i
thought
it
would
astonish
you.
but
he
hit
ever
so
hard,
cried
mercer,
and
it
took
me
off
my
guard,
because
it
was
i
who
was
to
hit
and
so
you
did,
my
lad,
as
hard
as
you
could
unscientifically,
while
he
only
just
threw
himself
forward
scientifically,
and
there
you
are
on
the
ground.
but
he
hit
so
hard
oh
no.
he
just
held
his
arm
right,
and
threw
the
weight
of
his
body
behind
it.
here,
lets
change
sides,
cried
mercer,
i
want
to
try
that
right,
said
lomax,
and
the
proceedings
were
reversed,
with
the
effect
that,
after
i
had
struck
at
my
adversary,
i
realised
that
i
had
thrown
my
head
forward
just
as
he
had
thrust
out
his
rigid
left
arm,
backed
by
the
whole
weight
of
his
body,
and
i
in
my
turn
went
down
sitting.
almost
as
much
astounded
as
mercer
had
been.
oh,
he
cried
excitedly,
thats
grand
i
wish
i
had
known
that
when
old
eely
was
giving
it
to
me
tother
day.
why,
i
feel
as
if
i
could
go
and
lick
him
now.
i
daresay
you
do,
cried
lomax
laughing
now
lets
have
that
over
again.
i
want
you
both
to
see
that
a
swing
round
blow,
or
even
a
straight
out
blow,
is
nothing
to
one
like
that,
for
you
see
youve
got
the
weight
of
the
body
and
the
speed
at
which
you
are
both
moving
to
give
it
force.
why,
in
a
charge,
when
the
men
were
at
full
gallop
with
swords
or
lances
extended,
we
had
but
never
mind
about
that,
he
added
quickly.
now
do
you
see
what
i
mean
yes,
we
cried,
and
we
went
through
the
attack
and
defence
over
and
over
again,
till
the
blows
grew
so
vigorous
that
i
began
to
feel
as
if
i
should
like
to
hit
harder.
that
will
do,
said
lomax
suddenly.
you
are
both
getting
warm,
and
its
half
past
six
nonsense
i
cried.
it
is,
my
lad;
there
goes
the
bell.
now
then,
let
me
untie
those
gloves.
thats
punishement;
but
this
severity
proved
of
ill
consequence,
for
instead
of
fighting
them
and
reducing
them
to
civility,
they
conceived
such
horror
of
the
spaniards,
that
they
resolved
to
detest
and
fly
their
sight
for
ever;
hence
the
greatest
part
died
in
caves
and
subterraneous
places
of
the
woods
and
mountains,
in
which
places
i
myself
have
ofter
seen
great
numbers
of
human
bones.
the
spaniards
finding
no
more
indians
to
appear
about
the
woods,
turned
away
a
great
number
of
dogs
they
had
in
their
houses,
and
they
finding
no
masters
to
keep
them,
betook
to
the
woods
fields
to
hunt
for
food
to
preserve
their
lives;
thus
by
degrees
they
became
unacquaninted
with
houses,
and
grew
wild.
this
is
the
truest
account
i
can
give
of
the
multitudes
of
wild
dogs
in
these
parts
but
besides
these
wild
mastiffs,
here
are
also
great
numbers
of
wild
horses
everywhere
all
over
the
island:
they
are
but
low
of
stature,
short
bodied,
with
great
heads,
long
necks,
and
big
or
thick
legs:
in
a
word,
they
have
nothing
handsome
in
their
shape.
they
run
up
and
down
commonly
in
troops
of
two
or
three
hundred
together,
one
going
always
before
to
lead
the
multitude:
when
thwy
meet
any
person
travelling
through
woods
or
fields,
stand
suffering
him
to
approach
till
he
can
almost
touch
them:
and
then
suddenly
starting,
they
betake
themselves
to
flight,
running
away
as
fast
as
they
can.
the
hunters
catch
them
week;
and
if
you
would
allow
me,
should
like
to
have
a
few
words
with
the
old
sergeant.
the
doctor
was
perfectly
agreeable;
and
when
they
were
going,
i
had
the
please=ure
for
it
was
a
pleasure
of
taking
them
down
to
lomax
little,
neatly
kept
place,
where
the
old
sergeant
stood
ready
to
draw
himself
up
and
salute,
with
his
eyes
lighting
and
a
proud
look
of
satisfaction
in
his
hard
face.
my
uncle
him
aside,
and
they
remained
talking
together,
while
my
mother
walked
up
and
down
me,
holding
my
hand
through
her
arm,
and
eagerly
whispering
her
hopes
that
i
would
very
careful,
that
i
would
not
run
into
any
danger
with
the
riding,
and
above
all,
mind
not
to
do
anything
uncle
would
not
like
of
course
promised
with
the
intention
of
performing,
and
soon
after
my
uncle
marched
back
with
lomax
they
did
not
seem
to
walk,
everything
apparently
gone
off
satisfactorily,
and
after
plenty
of
advice
my
uncle,
he
handed
my
mother
into
carriage,
followed
and
they
were
driven
off
watching
carriage
till
it
was
out
of
sight,
and
then
turned
to
lomax,
who
was
standing
as
upright
as
if
on
parade,
till
he
caught
and
then
he
gave
himself
a
jerk,
thrust
one
hand
into
his
pocket,
and
gave
the
place
a
slap.
youre
a
lucky
one,
he
said,
an
uncle
like
that
sir.
hah
theres
nothing
like
a
soldier.
am
lucky
i
said
rather
sourly
for
i
was
low
spirited
from
the
parting
i
had
just
gone
through
